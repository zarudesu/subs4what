    <h1>Subs4What — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Subs4What ("the App") is a subscription-based entertainment application. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Anonymous Authentication:</strong> We use Firebase Anonymous Authentication to create a unique anonymous identifier for your account. No personal information (name, email, phone number) is required or collected during this process.</p>
    <p><strong>Member Number:</strong> We store your unique member number and registration date in our database, linked only to your anonymous identifier.</p>
    <p><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Google Play. We do not collect or store your payment information. Google Play handles all billing data according to their own privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To assign and display your unique member number</li>
        <li>To verify your subscription status</li>
        <li>To provide absolutely nothing else (that's the point)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your information with third parties. Your anonymous identifier and member number are stored securely in Firebase Firestore.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as you maintain an active subscription. If you unsubscribe, your member number remains assigned to you but your account data may be deleted after 12 months of inactivity.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used for anonymous authentication and data storage. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> Used for subscription management. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
